Moonbit Double-Ended Queue Library

Overview
This library provides a double-ended queue (Deque) data structure implemented in the Moonbit programming language. A double-ended queue is a data structure that allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements at both ends (the front and the back). This implementation uses an array to store elements and maintains the state of the queue through index operations. It supports generic types, enabling it to store elements of any type.

Features
Generic Support: Can store elements of any type.
Dynamic Resizing: Automatically doubles the capacity when the queue reaches its limit.
Two-End Operations: Supports insertion and deletion of elements at both the front and the back of the queue.
Element Access: Allows accessing elements in the queue by index, as well as retrieving the front and back elements.
Iteration Capability: Provides iterators and traversal methods for easy manipulation of elements in the queue.
Reversal Operation: Can reverse the order of elements in the queue in-place.
Element Removal: Supports removing an element at a specified index.

Installation
Make sure you have the Moonbit development environment installed. Copy the code of this library into your project, and you're ready to use it.
